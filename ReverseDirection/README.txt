This code was written by request of 'Bill Smith'. It can be used to reverse the comunication process shown in my YouTube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k-E5GbOeQg&lc=z22gcvkq2w3kirchj04t1aokga1lgioioj2vxygiuyrgrk0h00410. Please note that the example program provided will show the output window (The window that actually pops up) once a connection is made. You will then be able to view incomming messages. Also ignore the fact that the folder is titled Socket Client not Socket Server, it is simply because I modifyed the client program to function as a server.
